# AutoIt-CMD-Utils  
*A small suite of AutoIt command-line utilities — starting with a tool that prints computer and user names to CMD.*

## 🧩 Description
This repository contains lightweight AutoIt console utilities.  
The first tool, **`get-tester-info`**, prints the computer (station) name and current user name directly to the Windows command prompt (CMD) — ideal for LabVIEW or automation scripts.
